# Ubuntu-Gnome-Dock-Launcher-for-NVIDIA-SMI

A launcher for the NVIDIA System Management Interface (SMI) that can be used through the Ubuntu Gnome dock.

This launcher is intended to be used as a convenience, instead of typing the "watch -n0.1 nvidia-smi" in a terminal, every time you want to monitor the status of your Nvidia graphics card (e.g., VRAM and GPU utilization while training deep learning models).

Tested with Ubuntu 22.04.
